- 🌱 Planting some saplings ⛩️ using what has been provided 🩸 and what is made available 🌊
- 🗡️ Carrying that sentient dagger visible in my profile image with me, but sheathed ☠️
- 👂 Aiming to listen more than I speak 👄 and refraining from taking up residence in any vectorized poles 🧭
- 🧿 And suffusing in the eternal and old first principles, to the extent that I'm not reliant on "borrowed light" 🪔 nor gas lights, nor ending my life in a "valiant" cliff jump that fellow cliff jumpers would tell me makes perfect sense - as look, we're all doing it, so it must be right 🧗 No.
