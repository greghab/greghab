Elucidations emanate from the distant dark.

Eyes bare no mind, for borrowed light does not shine to the meek.

Gravel crunches, crickets creak.

Sirens sound, minds grasping after all that is weak.

I know where I shall head not, so I continue to walk, trusting myself within the steps of my own two feet.
