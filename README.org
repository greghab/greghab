- I find iridescent plumage aesthetically interesting. This occurs in a non-trivial amount of bird species.
  - Also, I like how hummingbirds have an 'alert' visuality to them.
    - I would like to believe that I am alert to life, to the best extant I allow myself available.

Elucidations emanate from the distant dark.

Eyes bare no mind, for borrowed light does not shine to the meek.

Gravels crunch, crickets creak.

Sirens sound, minds grasp after all that fleets.

I know where I shall head not, so I continue to walk, trusting myself to that cadence radiating, and reverberating out of my own two feet.

- And people of various backgrounds (of which, variety through sight is just one factor of many) coming together in peace and with respect towards one another, wearing distinct attire, especially if it has cool patterns/heritage/meaning, you can hardly go wrong with that.
  - Whole, unique people are not threatening. Don't listen to the fear mongers. Life is more than skin deep, and more than what appears on the surface.
