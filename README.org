- "When the production finally wrapped, Arliss Howard went over to say goodbye to Kubrick. And he said, 'yeah well Stanley, I'll see you later.' And Stanley said, 'You know, you're going to miss me.' And Arliss said 'yeah, yeah I am going to, I will, I'll miss you.' He goes 'No, no. You're going to really miss me, when you're working on a set, and the director calls cut, we got it, let's move on. And you're going to know, that you don't have it, and that we shouldn't move on, and you're going to miss me. Because you know, that I would never cut, and say let's move on, unless I knew we had it. And you're going to miss me.' And Arliss said the first time that he went to work on another film, and the guy said cut, we got it, let's move on. He said, 'I really miss Stanley.'"
- "(Miyazaki) The filmmaking sounds raelly fun after hearing a lot of stories from you. (Kurosawa) It is indeed. Very fun. I can't wait for the shoot a day before. Our assistant directors might find it annoying when I come to the set too early. I think they just need more time to prepare for the shoot. And it frustrates me. Everyone enjoys it. So I tell them often. You can make something boring interesting by working hard. And they find themselves really having fun when working hard. Then I say 'hey it's time to go home' but they go 'Wait! Let me do one more!' And we shouldn't do a half-ass job lkee 'hey don't worry there. It won't be on camera' It's all or nothing. (Miyazaki) *laughts. (Kurosawa) They are indeed having fun on the set."
- "I have been working with the same crew for a long time. Of course, they work on multiple projects, but when I said I'm making a film, they come to my set. Otherwise, I wouldn't be here. We've been working for such a long time. We are like, 'Wow your hair's gone. Look how old we become'" - Kurosawa to Miyazaki
