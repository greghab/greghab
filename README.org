- 🌱 Sowing seeds ⛩️ with what has been provided 🩸 and with what is made available 🌊
- 🗡️ Equipping that sentient dagger visible in my profile image, but sheathed ☠️
- 👂 Aspiring to listen more than I speak 👄 and refraining from taking up residence upon any vectorized poles 🧭
- 🧿 Suffusing in the eternal and ancient first principles, such that I'm fortified enough to eject "borrowed light" 🪔 and gas light.
- 🌾 Cultivating discipline, and chiseling out of raw stone my character through day planning, journaling, gratitude practice, and reviews (consistent, long term vision and discipline is my biggest struggle, and yet my biggest vector for growth) 🗿
