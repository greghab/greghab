- 🗡️ Equipping the sentient dagger that constitutes my profile image, but equipping it sheathed ☠️
- 👂 Aspiring to listen more than I speak 👄 and refraining upon taking residence within any polarities 🧭
- 🧿 Suffusing within the ancient and eternal first principles, such that I'm fortified to eject "borrowed light" 🪔 and gas light
- 🌾 Cultivating discipline, and chiseling out of raw stone my character, through daily planning, journaling, gratitude, and reflection/review (a consistent, long-term vision and discipline provide me with my greatest struggles, yet are my consummate growth allies) 🗿
- ⛱️ Remaining equanimous, at ease, comfortable, and savoring all the ebbs and flows of life, while retaining perspective 🪷

- "We think we're in the drivers seat. Sometimes it's better to be in the passenger seat."

- "In a way Kubrick's playing around, in a sense of the music, with what he'd done previously. Having taken like a real classy, classical music score, for his previous film, now he's saying, OK well we're going to have Beethoven, but we're also going to have the William Tell Overture played 5 times too fast. Kubrick's being playful, in the same way as when Alex visits the record store. There in the record rack, is a copy of 2001. Which is obviously a great joke. *But also, he's also talking about a film director, who's given up being influenced by others. A film director, whose primary influence has become himself.*" - Alex Cox, Film Director, about A Clockwork Orange
- "He always knew what he was going to get. He said often that, every scene really has been done, *our job is always to do it just a little bit better*" - Jack Nicholson on Kubrick (The Shining)
- "It has prose that we have not seen since Joseph Conrad, and *it has precision of observing a small segment of the real world, with a precision, and also with a emphasis and a passion that is unprecedented in literature*. So whatever you are doing, whether you are a musician, a film maker, or into mathematics, or into computers, this kind of very very, deep, relentless, passion for what you are doing - very specific. And it's a great, wonderful book." - Werner Herzog on The Peregrine
