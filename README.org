Elucidations emanate from the distant dark.

Eyes bare no mind, for borrowed light does not shine to the meek.

Gravels crunch, crickets creak.

Sirens sound, mind grasps after all that is weak.

I know where I shall head not, so I continue to walk, trusting myself within the steps of my own two feet.
