- "You need to stop fighting a war for the Culture War, you need to stop fighting a war for influence. You need to start only focusing on the war for yourself. Because the only thing that's going to pay you ROI's for your focused energy, is your focus on you, not this. Not dedicating your attention to other people, and what they want to you to be mad about. No, take all that power back, put the blinders on, get to work. Because for the rest of your life, the world is going to be controlled by a handful of families. For the rest of your life, there's going to be elites. And average people, who don't enrich themselves, don't take control of their lives, they're going to be treated like cattle. That's how it is. They're going to be told stupid things, and they're going to believe stupid things. They're going to be sold things that hurt them, for a profit, and that's how it's going to work. That's how it's always worked. Whether the rights in power, whether the lefts in power, that's how power works."
- "When you have money, you don't listen to them."
- "You need to rely on their money. Because if you need their wage to eat, it's very difficult to have an opinion.""
