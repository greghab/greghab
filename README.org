Elucidations emanate from the distant dark.

Eyes bare no mind, for borrowed light does not shine to the meek.

Gravels crunch, crickets creak.

Sirens sound, minds grasp after all that fleets.

I know where I shall head not, so I continue to walk, trusting myself to that cadence, radiating, and reverberating, from within mein own two feet.

 "Remember, if you live for the praise and acceptance of others, you will conversely die by their criticism. Don’t give them that power." - Cameron Hanes, Endure

"Not only have I fed off the hate and have never faltered, but it’s also made me more focused, hungrier, and less satisfied.
There will always be those who want to see someone who’s motivated fail, because the effort of others reminds the weak
of their lack of passion and purpose.
There will always be those who want to feel that passion and purpose too, but it’s hard. The grind hurts sometimes.
So all they can do is hate and detract.
They don’t realize that apathy is death.
They don’t know that the approval of others doesn’t make a difference to the driven.
Hatred only provides fuel.
So please … I’m begging you.
Keep the vitriol coming." - Cameron Hanes, Endure

“When you’ve spent hours in a jhāna, you can call yourself a mystic....It is unforgettable. It overturns one’s conception of happiness. Even falling in love is not as enjoyable as this. It is unavoidable that one will inquire what is this bliss and where did it come from.”
— Ajahn Brahm, Mindfulness, Bliss, and Beyond
