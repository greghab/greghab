Elucidations emanate from the distant dark.

Eyes bare no mind, for borrowed light does not shine to the meek.

Gravels crunch, crickets creak.

Sirens sound, minds grasp after all that fleets.

I know where I shall head not, so I continue to walk, trusting myself to that cadence, radiating, and reverberating, from within mein own two feet.

"The excuse world comes up, is because when the world, life, doesn't give a damn what you're good at. It's just going to put challenges in front of you. So when that challenge comes up that you're not great at, the first thing the 'triple down on your strengths mentality does' is it forces you to say 'I'm not good at it. So I'm not going to do it'. Versus, saying 'I'm not good at, I'm going to be great at it. I'm going to figure out. I'm going to put in the work.' That's how you start to callus your mind. The excuses that we're making, are just because we're not good at it, so it makes us feel insecure. It makes us feel a certain way. That's why I tell everybody, you cannot fix anything in life, until you fix yourself. How many people do you know in your life, that give great advice. They give the best advice on planet earth, but their lives are all jacked up? No one looks inside themselves, because what they see inside is ugly. It's ugly. It's full of lies. It's full of secrets. It's full of insecurities. Once you dive into that, you have no more excuses, because you'll start ripping away those layers of insecurities, and at the other end of those layers, is exactly who you truly are. So do something everyday that sucks, get outside your comfort zone, triple down on your weaknesses, not your strengths - that's how you grow. That's how you stop making excuses." - David Goggins

"Don't ever be a theorist. Be a practioner. Be a guy who goes out there and actually does the work. Put yourself in situations - like when I was going through Hell Week, I got to see where my mind was. It's 130 hours, Hell Week is 130 hours. At hour 48, 72, your mind is a mess. Your all over the place. A theorist would tell me what he thinks is going to happen. A practioner dives into suffering, and as he's suffering, he's then writing the book, while he's suffering. It's easy to write a book while your in a nice 72 degree library, flipping the page. A practioner writes the book when he's in the hell. When he's in suffering. When it's 50 degree water. When everybody's quitting. Snots coming out your nose. That's how you really start to figure out what the mind and body are capable of. Don't read a book about it. Don't read what some man wrote. Put yourself in the environment. See how you start to talk to yourself in the worst times, in the worst situations. And that's how you start to develop that real self talk, that real visualization. The real tools to get through those hard times. You have to be willing to suffer, to get to the other side. And the other side of suffering, is a whole nother world that people don't even know exists." - David Goggins

"So I got an email the other day. This guys talking about, he's struggling to get up. He wants to go to the gym, and start grinding. Early in the morning. I said when I was 24, I had the same condition man. I had the same problem. So I started to study it. The more I studied it, I came up with this crazy conclusion, I was being a bitch. When I say bitch, it's not gender specific. It's a mindset. It's godless. It means weak. Soft. Feeling sorry for yourself. Get your ass up, and lace them up. Stay hard." - David Goggins

 "Remember, if you live for the praise and acceptance of others, you will conversely die by their criticism. Don’t give them that power." - Cameron Hanes, Endure

"Not only have I fed off the hate and have never faltered, but it’s also made me more focused, hungrier, and less satisfied.
There will always be those who want to see someone who’s motivated fail, because the effort of others reminds the weak
of their lack of passion and purpose.
There will always be those who want to feel that passion and purpose too, but it’s hard. The grind hurts sometimes.
So all they can do is hate and detract.
They don’t realize that apathy is death.
They don’t know that the approval of others doesn’t make a difference to the driven.
Hatred only provides fuel.
So please … I’m begging you.
Keep the vitriol coming." - Cameron Hanes, Endure

“When you’ve spent hours in a jhāna, you can call yourself a mystic....It is unforgettable. It overturns one’s conception of happiness. Even falling in love is not as enjoyable as this. It is unavoidable that one will inquire what is this bliss and where did it come from.”
