- "When the production finally wrapped, Arles Howard went over to say goodbye to Kubrick. And he said, 'yeah well Stanley, I'll see you later.' And Stanley said, 'You know, you're going to miss me.' And Arles said 'yeah, yeah I am going to, I will, I'll miss you.' He goes 'No, no. You're going to really miss me, when you're working on a set, and the director calls cut, we got it, let's move on. And you're going to know, that you don't have it, and that we shouldn't move on, and you're going to miss me. Because you know, that I would never cut, and say let's move on, unless I knew we had it. And you're going to miss me.' And Arles said the first time that he went to work on another film, and the guy said cut, we got it, let's move on. He said, 'I really miss Stanley.'"
