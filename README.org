- 🌱 Planting some saplings ⛩️ using what has been provided 🩸 and what is made available 🌊
- 🗡️ Carrying that sentient dagger visible in my profile image with me, but sheathed ☠️
- 👂 Aiming to listen more than I speak 👄 and refraining from remaining too long in any vectorized poles 🧭
- 🤖 And suffusing in universal and old first principles, to the extent that I'm not reliant on "borrowed light" 🪔 nor gas lights, nor ending my life in a "valiant" cliff jump that the societal cliff jumpers told me made perfect sense - as look, everyone's doing it, so it must be right 🧗
