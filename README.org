- "It could be very frustrating doing take after take, without any idea what Kubrick was looking for. Kubrick would say things to Modine like: 'uh Matthew, you're not going to do it that way, are you?', or 'What was that? You did it different that time. Why?' Kubrick didn't want the actors to 'make choices', and do something different just for the sake of it. When it would happen, he would tell Modine to do it again, but don't do his 'choice'. During the production, Modine wrote in his diary: 'It's not that my choice was wrong, it's that he's looking for something else. I have no idea what, and I don't think he know's what. It's not a thing, it's an intangible feeling. But I think that's what it is. Having no idea what. Not thinking. That by repetition, I might find myself hypnotized into being, not acting. That the whole process of acting is a journey toward being. Choices can't be right, if you're making them. Choices are conscious. Stanley's actors have to act as unconsciously as an eye blinks. As uncontrollable as a heart beat. This takes time. When Stanley told me he did a lot of takes, because actors didn't know his lines, he wasn't talking about words.' Modine spoke to Vivian Kubrick, after publishing his diary. Vivian wondered if the only people who could really understood Kubrick, were other artists, who have 'suffered to make themselves understood'. When the production finally wrapped, Arles Howard went over to say goodbye to Kubrick. And he said, 'yeah well Stanley, I'll see you later.' And Stanley said, 'You know, you're going to miss me.' And Arles said 'yeah, yeah I am going to, I will, I'll miss you.' He goes 'No, no. You're going to really miss me, when you're working on a set, and the director calls cut, we got it, let's move on. And you're going to know, that you don't have it, and that we shouldn't move on, and you're going to miss me. Because you know, that I would never cut, and say let's move on, unless I knew we had it. And you're going to miss me.' And Arles said the first time that he went to work on another film, and the guy said cut, we got it, let's move on. He said, 'I really miss Stanley.'"
