- 🌱 Sowing seeds ⛩️ with what has been provided 🩸 and with what is made available 🌊
- 🗡️ Equipping the sentient dagger that constitutes my profile image, but equipping it sheathed ☠️
- 👂 Aspiring to listen more than I speak 👄 and refraining upon taking residence within any polarities 🧭
- 🧿 Suffusing within the ancient and eternal first principles, such that I'm fortified to eject "borrowed light" 🪔 and gas light
- 🌾 Cultivating discipline, and chiseling out of raw stone my character, through daily planning, journaling, gratitude, and reflection/review (a consistent, long-term vision and discipline provide me with my greatest struggles, yet are my consummate growth allies) 🗿
