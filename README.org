- "I allow manipulation, to find out where my enemy wants me to go, and then I use my mind to break the trap and punish the perpetrators."
- "The last conversation I had with a therapist didn't go very well. I said I didn't believe in most of their field, and it was garbage. And she said, why? And I said, because there are some boys who don't drink alcohol because their dad was an alcoholic, and there are some boys who are alcoholics because their dad was an alcoholic.

She said, well no, it's not an exact science, but we have generalized rules that we can follow, that lead to patterns of behavior. I said, but I'm not a generalized person, I'm an exceptional person."
- "Real heroes are great, even when they lose."
- "The world is full of people who are not bad, but weak, people who bring unnecessary misfortune upon themselves and others for no reason but weakness. A heroic spirit that’s not devoted to human progress may be empty and meaningless, but goodness that is lacking in the spirit of heroism is often empty as well."
- "Everyone knows that the sexual appetite, like our other appetites, grows by indulgence. Starving men may think much about food, but so do gluttons; the gorged, as well as the famished, like titillations."
- "In the first place our warped natures, the devils who tempt us, and all the contemporary propaganda for lust, combine to make us feel that the desires we are resisting are so ‘natural’, so ‘healthy’, and so reasonable, that it is almost perverse and abnormal to resist them."
- "Surrender to all our desires obviously leads to impotence, disease, jealousies, lies, concealment, and everything that is the reverse of health, good humour, and frankness."
