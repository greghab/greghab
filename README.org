- 🌱 Sowing seeds ⛩️ with what has been provided 🩸 and with what is made available 🌊
- 🗡️ Equipping that sentient dagger visible in my profile image, but equipping it sheathed ☠️
- 👂 Aspiring to listen more than I speak 👄 and refraining upon taking residence within any vectorized polarities 🧭
- 🧿 Suffusing within the eternal and ancient first principles, such that I'm fortified to eject "borrowed light" 🪔 and gas light.
- 🌾 Cultivating discipline, and chiseling out of raw stone my character through daily planning, journaling, gratitude, and review (consistent, long term vision and discipline are my biggest struggles, and yet they are the largest vectors of my growth) 🗿
