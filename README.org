- "I allow manipulation, to find out where my enemy wants me to go, and then I use my mind to break the trap and punish the perpetrators."
- "The last conversation I had with a therapist didn't go very well. I said I didn't believe in most of their field, and it was garbage. And she said, why? And I said, because there are some boys who don't drink alcohol because their dad was an alcoholic, and there are some boys who are alcoholics because their dad was an alcoholic.

She said, well no, it's not an exact science, but we have generalized rules that we can follow, that lead to patterns of behavior. I said, but I'm not a generalized person, I'm an exceptional person."
