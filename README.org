- "You can get on the internet, and you can clearly see what's a truth or a lie. It's so easy to see what the mainstream media is lying about. It's so easy to see who's full of crap. It's so easy to see what systems have been built that are manipulative, and don't help people - like colleges for example... And you're telling me 'It's bad, everyone's brainwashed.' No, no. People used to actually really be brainwashed, because there was no other counter media. Now you have it. You are empowered. Everything in your life is good. And if you just use these tools - Klaus Shwab, I promise you, is not going to show up at your house, and try and tar and feather you. Yeah, some really weird things have happened. But your only way out of it, is putting your head  down and focusing and getting to fucking work. There's never been a time in history, where a bunch of whiny complainers, got together, and changed anything. Look at the 1960s hippy. There's a Vietnam War going on, and the governments doing all sorts of loopy stuff, and Richard Nixon was corrupt, and bahrdahdahdahdah. All these people got together, and they just behrdehedehdeh, the establishments bad, the establishments bad, they're manipulating us, the man, the man. Does this sound similar to what's going on right now? They'res all these hippy leaders leading all these people (and also selling stuff on the side and making money from it). And at the end of all of it, the Culture War moved on, the elites did nothing, they didn't change anything, because they don't care what you have to say, it doesn't matter, you have to have power to affect them. They moved on. All the people and 'influencers' then, they moved on. All the people that sat around griping and whining, and were distracted the whole entire time, and wasted all their time, all their energy and focus, they were just left behind. They got nothing. And that's going to happen to you, if you get involved in all this 'based' culture 'influence' stuff. You're living, again, in the best time to be alive, the most empowered time to be alive, and you're choosing, if you're a part of this, to complain. And instead of using every ounce of your energy and focus to alleviate this problem that is going on, and empower yourself, enrich yourself, make yourself healthy, your inside, saying no no no, I'm going to take my hard drive and dedicate it to the 'Culture War'. What a waste! What a waste! Because, participating in this Culture War, is going to give you no ROI. The only thing that's going to save you, the only thing that's going to give you any form of defense, is gaining power. And you know how to do that? You turn off all this crap. You stop looking at these influencers, who are essentially, I hate to break it to you - they find out what you're frustrated about, they realize they can get lots of likes and attention if they just keep complaining. How many YouTube channels do you see, and all they do is complain about the Left and Wokies? And then what do they do? Oh they make money from doing that. And then they also start selling stuff. And they make a lot of money doing that. Do you notice a lot of people on the 'based' side are getting rich? Did you notice Ben Shapiro is making like 100 million dollars a year now? Making you mad? Kind of strange. Did you notice when wokeness was becoming a thing, what happened with all the woke influencers? They started making all this money - they got rich, from being woke, and making woke people mad. And then they're just kind of fading in to the shadows now - they're going to go live their life and be rich, and all of the woke people are going to be left around embarrased. Well what do you think is happening right here? You need to stop fighting a war for the Culture War, you need to stop fighting a war for influence. You need to start only focusing on the war for yourself. Because the only thing that's going to pay you ROI's for your focused energy, is your focus on you, not this. Not dedicating your attention to other people, and what they want to you to be mad about. No, take all that power back, put the blinders on, get to work. Because for the rest of your life, the world is going to be controlled by a handful of families. For the rest of your life, there's going to be elites. And average people, who don't enrich themselves, don't take control of their lives, they're going to be treated like cattle. That's how it is. They're going to be told stupid things, and they're going to believe stupid things. They're going to be sold things that hurt them, for a profit, and that's how it's going to work. That's how it's always worked. Whether the rights in power, whether the lefts in power, that's how power works. And your only way to survive in this whirlpool, is to become powerful yourself. You have to become powerful yourself. Because all the world is, is just these very powerful people creating this whirlpool, and everyone's stuck in it, and being thrown all the way around the place. And they think 'man this whirlpool is just nasty!' But it's really just these people pulling the strings right here. You need to get the power, to either build yourself a giant boat, so that the whirlpool just can't bother you, or you can get so powerful, you can climb out of the whirlpool, and you can start pushing the people back, actually directly. You know why Mark Zuckerberg and all these people can control your speech? It's because they worked really hard, and gained a lot of power. That's how they can do it. They didn't sit around complaining on Twitter. If you want to actually fight back, if this is important to you, you need to gain power. You don't need to be complaining. You don't need to be trying to solve problems, and arguing on Twitter. You just need to be gaining money and power. Or, if you're like me, and have noticed the world is actually pretty damn neat - there's a lot of really fun stuff to do, there's a lot of cool stuff to enjoy, and no one's really going to stop you from doing that, as long as you keep your head on a swivel, and stay wise, you can just gain a lot of power, and money, and achieve all the things you want in your life... Well you can just do that to. And then when the Matrix and the Elites, start acting up, you don't like what they're doing, you just move. You just move. There are plenty of places in the world, where whatever cultural views you have, they completly agree with you. Just go there. That's it. Or you can just spend all your time, energy, and focus, being angry about all this stuff, and the Matrix. Which is going to give you no ROI... If you want to actually gain power, you want to actually have control of your life, you want to actually escape the matrix, shut the fuck up. Stop whining. Get to work."
