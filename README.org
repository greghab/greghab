- 🌱 Sowing seeds ⛩️ with what has been provided 🩸 and with what is made available 🌊
- 🗡️ Equipping that sentient dagger visible in my profile image, but equipping it sheathed ☠️
- 👂 Aspiring to listen more than I speak 👄 and refraining upon taking residence within any polarities 🧭
- 🧿 Suffusing within the eternal and ancient first principles, such that I'm fortified to eject "borrowed light" 🪔 and gas light.
- 🌾 Cultivating discipline, and chiseling out of raw stone my character through daily planning, journaling, gratitude, and review/reflection (consistent, long term vision and discipline are my biggest struggles, and yet they are the largest vectors for my growth, and future) 🗿
