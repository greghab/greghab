Elucidations emanate from the distant dark.

Eyes bare no mind, for borrowed light does not shine to the meek.

Gravels crunch, crickets creak.

Sirens sound, minds grasp after all that fleets.

I know where I shall head not, so I continue to walk, trusting myself within the steps of my own two feet.
