- 🌱 Sowing seeds ⛩️ with what has been provided 🩸 and what is made available 🌊
- 🗡️ Equipping that sentient dagger visible in my profile image, but in its sheath ☠️
- 👂 Aspiring to listen more than I speak 👄 and refraining from taking up residence upon any vectorized poles 🧭
- 🧿 Suffusing in the eternal and old first principles, to the extent that I'm not reliant on "borrowed light" 🪔 nor gas light.
- 🌾 Cultivating discipline, and chiseling out of raw stone my character through day planning, journaling, gratitude practice, and reviews (consistent, long term vision and discipline is my biggest struggle, as it likely is with most individuals) 🗿
