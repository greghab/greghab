*The Essentials:*

#+begin_quote
Elucidations emanate from the distant dark.

Eyes bare no mind, for borrowed light does not shine to the meek.

Gravels crunch, crickets creak.

Sirens sound, minds grasp after all that fleets.

I know where I shall head not, so I continue to walk, trusting myself to that cadence, radiating, and reverberating, from within mein own two feet.

"... Rebirth is possible through discpline. Which is the only thing capable of altering your DNA. It is the skeleton key, that can get you past all the gatekeepers, and into each and every room you wish to enter. Even the one's built to keep you the fuck out... Commit to becoming the motherfucker with a never ending task list. This is where you make up the difference in potential. By learning to maximize what you do have, you'll not only level the playing field, but also surpass those born with more natural ability, and advantages than you. Let your hours become days, then weeks, then years of effort. Allow discipline to seep into your cells, until work becomes a reflex as automatic as breathing. With discipline as your medium, your life will become a work of art. Discipline builds mental endurance, because when effort is your main priority, you stop looking for everything to be enjoyable. Our phones and social media, have turned too many of us inside out with envy and greed, as we get inundated with other people's success. Their new cars, and houses. Big contracts, resort vacations, and romantic get aways. We see how much fun everyone else is having, and feel like the world is passing us by, so we bitch about it. And then wonder why we are not where we want to be. When you become disciplined, you don't have time for that bullshit. Your insecurities become alarm bells, reminding you that doing your chores, or homework, to the utmost of your ability, and putting in extra time on the job, or in the gym, are requirements for a life well lived. A drive for self-optimization, adn daily repetition, will build your capacity for work, and give you confidence that you can take on more. With discipline as your engine, your workload and output will double, then triple. What you won’t see, at least not at first, is the fact that your own personal evolution has begun to bear fruit. You won’t see it because you’ll be too busy taking action. Discipline does not have a belief system. It transcends class, color, and gender. It cuts through all the noise and strife. If you think that you are behind the eight ball for whatever reason, discipline is the great equalizer. It erases all disadvantages. Nowadays, it doesn’t matter where you are from or who you are; if you are disciplined, there will be no stopping you... The pull to stay lazy was stronger than it had ever been. That’s how it works when you’re trying to change. The call to remain complacent will only grow louder until you silence it with a pattern of behavior that leaves no doubt about your mission... It was during those days of struggle and striving, when I didn’t know if I would actually graduate or be accepted by the Air Force, that I first realized I am at my best when I am a disciple of discipline. The further I got away from it, and from Sgt. Jack, the worse I became. While I still didn’t like waking up early or most of the chores I had to do, those were the very things that turned me into someone I could be proud of.... It will always be up to you to find the lesson in every shitty situation and use it to become stronger, wiser, and better. No matter what comes down on your head, you must find a glimmer of light, remain positive, and never treat yourself as a victim. Especially if you intend to thrive in a harsh world where you have to work for everything that matters. I’m not talking about material things. I’m talking about self-respect, self-love, and self-mastery." - David Goggins, Never Finished

"The excuse world comes up, is because when the world, life, doesn't give a damn what you're good at. It's just going to put challenges in front of you. So when that challenge comes up that you're not great at, the first thing the 'triple down on your strengths mentality does' is it forces you to say 'I'm not good at it. So I'm not going to do it'. Versus, saying 'I'm not good at, I'm going to be great at it. I'm going to figure out. I'm going to put in the work.' That's how you start to callus your mind. The excuses that we're making, are just because we're not good at it, so it makes us feel insecure. It makes us feel a certain way. That's why I tell everybody, you cannot fix anything in life, until you fix yourself. How many people do you know in your life, that give great advice. They give the best advice on planet earth, but their lives are all jacked up? No one looks inside themselves, because what they see inside is ugly. It's ugly. It's full of lies. It's full of secrets. It's full of insecurities. Once you dive into that, you have no more excuses, because you'll start ripping away those layers of insecurities, and at the other end of those layers, is exactly who you truly are. So do something everyday that sucks, get outside your comfort zone, triple down on your weaknesses, not your strengths - that's how you grow. That's how you stop making excuses." - David Goggins

"Don't ever be a theorist. Be a practioner. Be a guy who goes out there and actually does the work. Put yourself in situations - like when I was going through Hell Week, I got to see where my mind was. It's 130 hours, Hell Week is 130 hours. At hour 48, 72, your mind is a mess. Your all over the place. A theorist would tell me what he thinks is going to happen. A practioner dives into suffering, and as he's suffering, he's then writing the book, while he's suffering. It's easy to write a book while your in a nice 72 degree library, flipping the page. A practioner writes the book when he's in the hell. When he's in suffering. When it's 50 degree water. When everybody's quitting. Snots coming out your nose. That's how you really start to figure out what the mind and body are capable of. Don't read a book about it. Don't read what some man wrote. Put yourself in the environment. See how you start to talk to yourself in the worst times, in the worst situations. And that's how you start to develop that real self talk, that real visualization. The real tools to get through those hard times. You have to be willing to suffer, to get to the other side. And the other side of suffering, is a whole nother world that people don't even know exists." - David Goggins

"So I got an email the other day. This guys talking about, he's struggling to get up. He wants to go to the gym, and start grinding. Early in the morning. I said when I was 24, I had the same condition man. I had the same problem. So I started to study it. The more I studied it, I came up with this crazy conclusion, I was being a bitch. When I say bitch, it's not gender specific. It's a mindset. It's godless. It means weak. Soft. Feeling sorry for yourself. Get your ass up, and lace them up. Stay hard." - David Goggins

"Not only have I fed off the hate and have never faltered, but it’s also made me more focused, hungrier, and less satisfied.
There will always be those who want to see someone who’s motivated fail, because the effort of others reminds the weak
of their lack of passion and purpose.
There will always be those who want to feel that passion and purpose too, but it’s hard. The grind hurts sometimes.
So all they can do is hate and detract.
They don’t realize that apathy is death.
They don’t know that the approval of others doesn’t make a difference to the driven.
Hatred only provides fuel.
So please … I’m begging you.
Keep the vitriol coming." - Cameron Hanes, Endure

*On boundries:*
- "Boundaries all the fucking way."
- "Boundaries define acceptable behavior, and enforce it."
- "Boundaries project honesty, and directness. Secrecy, is subversion, deceit, two-faced ness, non-clarity, at-will ness."
- "The people who tell you to remove your boundaries, are the sociopathic narcisstic motherfuckers, that want you to let your guard down, so that your smitten to not hold them accountable, and so you take in aborinant amounts of their fucking traumatic bullshit fucked upness trauma which they spew on you by relentlessy tearing you down and making you seem like the crazy fucked up one, gaslight the anus out your mouth, and then they can start shipping poison via Ox carts into your castle, poison your whole shit, kill off 90% of your population, then laugh at you for not running your kingdom correctly, and then asking like an lying ass bitch, what is going wrong with your kingdom? How can I help? Fake concern, snake ass motherfuckers. Fuck all of that. You are a fucking snake, it's absurd. Boundaries all the way. Get the fuck outta here, I got my big barrel cannons locked and loaded on your ass. And I got legions on standby, and helicopters circling over head, and a fucking swat team hidden in the bushes next to you. You can speak to me outside the fuckin gates, and you speak correct. And come with a fucking agenda to meetings with me, so we can stay on track, cause I sure as hell am coming with an agenda, cause your ass is suspicious as the demon incarnate himself, and I want this meeting wrapped up ASAP. No more fucking 1 hour+ meetings, with no fucking agenda, about of bullshit, and not about engineering. Let's talk business. I only discuss engineering, especially with motherfuckers like you, who can't reverse a god damn linked list, or stop being a sociopath to save their life. God damn weird motherfuckers. Human hybrid fucks, don't know if they got a soul, other than some fucking pitbull animalistic spirit, that wants to tear and eat other's flesh, and stand on top of a fucking hill, with slaves in chains all around them, speaking in their head to some fucking 'god' they think their talking to, and other weirdo bullshit. I don't know what type of god thinks condones the way your moving. Just bulldoze over everything, got in. But not anymore motherfucker, cause my shits well defended. Bulldozer can't cross a big ass moat, with crocodiles and pirahanas in it. I can see you. I can see you motherfucker. Your tricks don't work on me anymore. I've learned. I've grown. I'm a man now. You cannot enter my city. You will forever, have to remain outside the moat, and outside the gates. It's not personal, I'm calm, and it just is how it is, and how it's got to go, for the best for both of us. We need to keep distance. We need to maintain boundaries, and keep a high standard enforced."

“When you’ve spent hours in a jhāna, you can call yourself a mystic....It is unforgettable. It overturns one’s conception of happiness. Even falling in love is not as enjoyable as this. It is unavoidable that one will inquire what is this bliss and where did it come from.”

~ Something about how you don't need to be David Goggins to be enlightened. In a sense, he's killing his body, stressing himself, which is similar to what the Buddha did with the ascetics. But this is not needed. You can go directly there, and acquire right view. Meditation (I.E Vipassana, and 10 day retreats), restraint, and studying right view is a good step. - Frank Yang
